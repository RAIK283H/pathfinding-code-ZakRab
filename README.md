# Pathfinding Starter Code

I added the path length to the scoreboard

My algo rithem is

add initial node

while the target node hasn't been visited then get the random neighbors from adjacency list adding each rand node to the path and to seen set

once target has been found

then while the exit node hasn't been visited then get the random neighbors from adjacency list adding each rand node to the path and to seen set
